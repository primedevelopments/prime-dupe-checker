# What is the Prime Dupe-Checker?
The Prime Dupe-Checker for Forge **1.8.9** is a Minecraft mod,
which was made to scan items in the game SkyBlock on the Hypixel Network for duplicated items

# What does the mod do?
Once you activate the mod by installing it and joining SkyBlock, you have to put "/pdc on" in your chat and the mod will scan your inventory for duplicated items, which means if somebody has the same item as you it will be flagged as a duplicated item and automatically be marked as a red item.

Example:
